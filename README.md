# React + Redux
I will use a shopping cart example to illustrate the use and the benefits of `redux-saga` and `flux architecture` inside ReactJS.

## How to`s 

1 - First clone this repo using `git clone` command inside your terminal <br>
2 - Run `yarn` command inside your terminal, to install all project dependencies using the same package manager that i use (you can use `npm install` if prefer...)<br>
3 - Run `yarn server` to start json-server backend placeholder at http://localhost:3333 <br>
4 - Run `yarn start` to initialize this application at http://localhost:3000<br>

Enjoy!
